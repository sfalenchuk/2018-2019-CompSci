            <h5>USS John C. Stennis</h5>

            <p>
            The USS John C. Stennis is a US Navy Nimitz Class aircraft carrier, the seventh of it's kind. It's designation, CVN 74, is unique to the ship with the C representing that it's a carrier, the V representing it's fixed wing aircraft, and the N representing it's nuclear powered engine.
            </p>

            The mission of John C. Stennis and her air wing (CVW-9) is to conduct sustained combat air operations while forward-deployed. The carrier's air wing consists of eight to nine squadrons of various aircraft. Attached aircraft are Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, MH-60Rs, MH-60Ss, and E-2C Hawkeyes.</p>

            <p>The air wing serves to carry out missions and operations in range of the carrier. This carrier often acts as the lead ship of a larger carrier strike group, accompanied by several supply ships, destroyers, and submarines.</p>

            <p>John C. Stennis's two nuclear reactors give her virtually unlimited range and endurance and a top speed in excess of 30 knots (56 km/h, 34.5 mph). \the ship has four steam catapults and four arresting engines, letting her to launch and land aircraft rapidly and simultaneously. The ship carries approximately 3 million US gallons (11,000 cubic meters) of fuel for the planes and escorts, and enough weapons and supplies for extended operations without a need to restock.</p>

            <p>For defense, in addition to her air wing and accompanying vessels, the John C. Stennis has several missle launchers, torpedo launchers, and point defense guns</p>

            <p>The nuclear-powered USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) was contracted on 29 March 1988, and the keel was laid on 13 March 1991 at Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, Virginia.</p>

            <p>The ship was christened on 11 November 1993, in honor of Senator John Cornelius Stennis, a Democrat from Mississippi who served in the Senate from 1947 to 1989. .</p>

            <h5>History</h5>

            <h5>1998</h5>
            <p>On 26 February 1998, John C. Stennis left Norfolk for her maiden deployment, sailing the Suez Canal on 7 March and arriving in the Persian Gulf on 11 March 1998, sent to relieve USS George Washington in conducting Operation Southern Watch missions. John C. Stennis departed the Persian Gulf on 19 July 1998 for her new home port of San Diego, California, arriving on 26 August 1998.</p>

            <p>In October 1998, she entered a six-month maintenance and upgrade period at North Island, returning to sea in April 1999. During the maintenance period, a jet blast deflector collapsed, severely injuring two sailors.</p>

            <h5>1999</h5>
            <p>On 30 November 1999, the ship ran aground in a shallow area adjacent to the turning basin near North Island. Silt clogged the intake pipes to the steam condensing systems for the nuclear reactor plants, causing the carrier's two nuclear reactors to be shut down (one reactor by crew, the other automatically) for a period of 45 minutes. She was towed back to her pier for maintenance and observation for the next two days. The cleanup cost was about $2 million.</p>

            <h5>2000</h5>
            <p>On 7 January 2000, John C. Stennis deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve USS John F. Kennedy in Operation Southern Watch. During the deployment, the ship made port visits to South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Tasmania and Pearl Harbor, before returning to San Diego on 3 July 2000.</p>

            <p>Following the September 11 attacks, John C. Stennis conducted Noble Eagle missions off the U.S. West Coast. In 2000 and 2001, John C. Stennis was part of Carrier Group 7.
            </p>

            <h5>2001</h5>
            <p>On 12 November 2001, two months earlier than scheduled, the ship left on her third deployment to the U.S. Fifth Fleet area of responsibility in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, returning to San Diego on 28 May 2002.</p>

            <h5>2004</h5>
            <p>From 24 May to 1 November 2004, John C. Stennis conducted her fourth major overseas deployment, participating in Exercise Northern Edge 2004 in the Gulf of Alaska, RIMPAC Exercise off Hawaii, exercises with Kitty Hawk off Japan and goodwill visits to Japan, Malaysia and Western Australia. Shortly after returning from deployment to San Diego, John C. Stennis changed her home port to Naval Station Bremerton, Washington. </p>

            <p>Following a maintenance cycle and pre-deployment training exercises, the carrier returned to Bremerton, Washington, and the carrier was certified surge ready, meaning the ship maintained a high state of readiness in case of an unscheduled deployment.</p>

            <div class="powr-social-feed" id="8cb28ac7_1550540048"></div>

            
            <p>USS John C. Stennis arrives in Bremerton on 31 August 2007.
            On 20 January 2007, the carrier and her group set sail for the Persian Gulf as part of an increase in US military presence. John C. Stennis arrived in the area on 19 February 2007, joining USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the United States Fifth Fleet area of operations. This marked the first time since 2003 that there were two aircraft carrier battle groups in the region simultaneously.</p>

            <p>On 23 May 2007, John C. Stennis, along with eight other warships including the aircraft carrier Nimitz and amphibious assault ship Bonhomme Richard, passed through the Strait of Hormuz. US Navy officials said it was the largest such move since 2003.</p>

            <p>On 31 August 2007 John C. Stennis returned to Bremerton.</p>

            <h5>2009</h5>
            <p>John C. Stennis departed Bremerton for a 6-month deployment to the western Pacific on 13 January 2009. On 24 April, the ship arrived in Singapore. That same day, one of the ship's sailors was crushed and killed while working from a small harbor boat to secure a drain that discharges oily water from the aircraft catapults.</p>

            <p>On 29 April, the ship's executive officer, Commander David L. Burnham, was relieved by Rear Admiral Mark A. Vance over unspecified personal conduct. Burnham was reassigned to a base in San Diego, pending an investigation.</p>

            <p>After participating in exercises with Japan Maritime Self Defense Force and the Republic of Korea, as well as joint exercise Northern Edge 2009, John C. Stennis returned from deployment in early July 2009. Carrier Air Wing 9 debarked on 6 July at NAS North Island, prior to the ship's arrival at her homeport of Bremerton on 10 July.</p>

            <h5>2011</h5>

            <p>
            On 30 March 2011, a F/A-18 Hornet suffered an uncontained catastrophic engine failure, exploded and caught fire just before launch from John C. Stennis about 100 miles (160 km) off the coast of San Diego during launch and recovery training operations. Eleven flight deck crewmen were injured.</p>

            <p>On 18 December 2011, the final command-and-control mission for U.S. forces over Iraq was flown by an E-2C Hawkeye from Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 112 (VAW-112), catapulting off the carrier John C. Stennis at 7:32 am and returning at 11:04 a.m, both local time. This mission effectively ended U.S. naval support for Operation New Dawn.</p>

            <h5>2012</h5>
            <p>On 3 January 2012, Iranian General Ataollah Salehi warned John C. Stennis "not to return to the Persian Gulf." The United States dismissed the warning.</p>

            <p>On 7 January, John C. Stennis led the rescue of an Iranian-flagged fishing vessel, Al Mulahi, following her seizure by pirates. The strike group dispatched a destroyer which both rescued the vessel and aided in the capture of the pirates.</p>

            <p>On 2 March 2012, John C Stennis returned home from her 7-month deployment to homeport Bremerton, Washington.</p>

            <p>On 7 July 2012, crew members were informed that John C. Stennis would be returning to the Middle East in August, much sooner than expected.</p>

            <p>On 27 August 2012, John C. Stennis departed to the Middle East originally for six months, but was extended to eight.</p>

            <h5>2013</h5>
            <p>On 1 April 2013, the ship arrived at Changi Naval Base in Singapore. Local ITE students were invited for a guided tour inside the aircraft carrier.</p>

            <p>Following that the ship sailed to Pearl Harbor, where she performed a week long cruise to San Diego.</p>

            <p>On 3 May 2013, John C. Stennis arrived at her home port of Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington.</p>

            <h5>2014</h5>
            <p>John C. Stennis completed sea trials and was certified on 10 November as a Naval Operational asset.</p>

            <h5>2015</h5>
            <p>In mid-January 2015, John C. Stennis departed her home port of Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington.</p>

            <h5>2016</h5>
            <p>On 15 January 2016, John C. Stennis left Naval Base Kitsap for a scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific. On 19 April she arrived to Singapore for a regularly scheduled port visit after completing a training exercise in the Philippines. On 26 April 2016, China denied John C. Stennis, and her escort ships, permission to make a port visit to Hong Kong. On 10 August, the carrier arrived in San Diego, California for offload and disembarkation of CVW-9. On 14 August, John C. Stennis arrived back to homeport, Naval Base Kitsap, finishing a Western Pacific deployment and RIMPAC exercise.</p>

            <h5>2017</h5>
            <p>From February to August 2017, John C. Stennis was in overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.</p>

            <h5>2018</h5>
            <p>On 2 August 2018, it was announced that John C. Stennis will change homeport to Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
